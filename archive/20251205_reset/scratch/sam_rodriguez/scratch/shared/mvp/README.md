MVP Shared workspace for MVP project triage and artifacts.

Structure overview:
- status.md: lightweight per-epic/status board
- epic-1, epic-2, epic-3, epic-4: per-epic folders with status notes
- etl/: minimal ETL skeleton (CSV -> Parquet) for MVP data
- apps/mvp-frontend/: frontend scaffold placeholder (starter README)

How to use:
- Update per-epic statuses in status.md and link to relevant docs
- Run ETL skeleton to validate data path locally
- Use the frontend placeholder as a placeholder integration point
