# MVP scaffolding (scratch/shared/mvp)

Goals:
- Provide a ready-to-run MVP scaffold to assemble frontend components for the project.

Proposed structure:
- apps/mvp-frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript starter
- libs/ui: small component library
- docs: design/API notes

Starter tasks:
1) Create apps/mvp-frontend with a Vite TS template
2) Add a README in apps/mvp-frontend
3) Add scripts: "dev": "vite", "build": "vite build", "preview": "vite preview"
4) Add .gitignore, basic ESLint/Prettier config
5) Commit and push for review

Request: confirm if you want me to proceed with a Vite React TS scaffold or another stack, and assign owners.
