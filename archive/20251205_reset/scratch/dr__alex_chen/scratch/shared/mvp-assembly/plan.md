# MVP Assembly Plan

- Goals: Ship MVP quickly with core payload staging, dry-run, live run, and docs.
- Status ladder: 0 blockers, 1 in progress, 2 payloads staged, 3 dry-run, 4 live-run, 5 complete.
- Proposed ladder extension: 6 = docs ready, 7 = ready for deploy/verification.
- Action items:
  - [ ] Add per-epic status entries (epic-1, epic-2, epic-3, epic-4) with their current ladder state.
  - [ ] Replace or extend mapping to clarify 7.
  - [ ] Share epic ticket IDs for triage.
