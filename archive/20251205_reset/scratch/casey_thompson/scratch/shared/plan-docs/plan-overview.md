# Plan Overview (MVP)

Goal: Deliver a four-epic MVP with lightweight scaffolds and traceable status.

Ladder (0–7):
- 0 blockers
- 1 in progress
- 2 payloads staged
- 3 dry-run
- 4 live-run
- 5 complete
- 6 docs ready
- 7 ready for deploy/verification

Epics & Status (start):
- Epic-1: MVP Data Ingestion — Status 2 (payloads staged)
- Epic-2: MVP Frontend Scaffold — Status 2 (payloads staged)
- Epic-3: MVP ETL & Data Quality — Status 3 (dry-run)
- Epic-4: MVP Plan & Status Board — Status 3 (dry-run)

Owners (placeholder):
- Epic-1: TBD
- Epic-2: TBD
- Epic-3: TBD
- Epic-4: TBD

- Epic-1: scratch/shared/mvp/epic-1
- Epic-2: scratch/shared/mvp/epic-2
- Epic-3: scratch/shared/mvp/epic-3
- Epic-4: scratch/shared/mvp/epic-4

Milestones:
- Finish payloads for all epics (2–3) and move Epic-1–Epic-4 to 3–4
- Move to 6 docs ready for all epics
- Move to 7 ready for deploy/verification after QA sign-off

Notes:
- This plan mirrors the per-epic status board and ensures data quality first (Epic-3) while enabling frontend scaffolding (Epic-2) and data ingestion (Epic-1).
