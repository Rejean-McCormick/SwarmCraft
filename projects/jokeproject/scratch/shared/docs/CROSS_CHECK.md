Planned fast-track actions (next 1-2 days)
- API contract alignment: verify that endpoint specs match security tests and docs; publish delta notes
- Testing: expand coverage for edge cases and ensure CI runs tests on push
- Docs: finalize API contract sections and link to code references
- Schedule: 15-minute sync with all leads to confirm final contract and plan

Risks and notes
- Potential contract-test gaps: ensure near-term cross-check before final deploy
- Docs progress depends on a stable API contract
